"""Post-OCR cleanup: fix cross-script confusion, common spec-char misreads,
and near-misses against a language-aware frequency dictionary.

Tesseract invoked with a multi-language model (e.g. `ukr+rus+eng`) routinely
produces cross-script garbage: Czech `ukončení` comes out as `икопбепі` and
English `one` as `опе`, because Cyrillic glyphs like `о к и п е` are visually
identical to Latin `o k u n e`. This module fixes three classes of errors:

1. **Script confusion.** A word that contains characters from a script
   incompatible with its page's dominant script is re-mapped using a
   visual-similar character table and validated against `wordfreq`.

2. **Special-character glyph errors.** A small hand-curated table for known
   OCR misreads of non-alphabetic symbols (e.g. `№` → `Ме` / `Мо`).

3. **Near-miss edit-distance.** For short mixed-script tokens where script
   confusion alone doesn't produce a valid word, a bounded edit-distance
   search considers alternatives reachable via one substitution and picks
   the one with the highest frequency in the target language, if above a
   minimum threshold.

The whole pass is conservative — it only edits a word when it has high
confidence that the replacement is correct. Unknown tokens are left alone,
so proper nouns, product names, and specialised jargon survive untouched.
